<h1> Description : </h1>
<h3> <p> This is my mother's recipe for authentic German potato salad. 
    Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. 
    I often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. 
    There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!</p></h3>
<h1> History : </h1>
<h3><p> LPotato salad is widely believed to have originated in Germany, 
    spreading largely throughout Europe, the United States, and later Asia.
     American potato salad most likely originated from recipes brought to the U.S. 
    by way of German and other European immigrants during the nineteenth century</p></h3>
   <h1> <p>Ingredients : </p> </h1>
   <h3> <ul>
       <li>    Potatoes: We recommend using waxy potatoes (such as New Potatoes) because they hold their shape well. Yukon Gold, an all-purpose variety, is also a good choice.  </li>
       <li>   Bacon: Bacon (and its grease) adds tons of meaty flavor to the hearty German potato salad.  </li>
       <li>    Onion: An onion, cooked in bacon grease, lends even more complexity and flavor.  </li>
       <li>    Sugar: A bit of white sugar gives the savory potato salad subtle sweetness.  </li>
       <li>    Vinegar: White vinegar adds tanginess that cuts through the richness from the potatoes and bacon.  </li>
       <li>    Seasonings and herbs: This German potato salad recipe is seasoned with salt, pepper, and fresh parsley.</li>
